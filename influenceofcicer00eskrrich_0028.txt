14 CICERO’S INFLUENCE UPON AUGUSTINE'S ORATORICAL THEORY

ex illis, et qui propriis verbis minor erat, magnorum testimonio
quodammodo crescat.

Corresponding to Scripture14 for the ecclesiastical orator is phi—
losophy, or res, for the ideal orator of Cicero. As regards his intel—
lectual equipment, Cicero says, that, to ‘the end that his ideal orator
may be fully equipped with the proper knowledge on general matters
as well as with a technical knowledge of the specific subject which
he at any time may be treating, he must provide himself with certain
“topics’' which come under the domain of philosophy.

Referring to the highest powers of the orator as consisting in
exciting the minds of men to anger, hatred 01 grief; or in recalling
them from these more violent emotions to gentleness and pity, a
thing which he will never accomplish by eloquence unless he has
obtained a thorough insight into the nature of humanity, and under—
stands how the minds of men are moved or restrained, Cicero says,
De Orat. I, 12. 54; Atque totus hic locus philosophorum proprius
videtur neque orator me auctore unquam repugnabit.

Of “topics,'' or loci, he says again in De Orat. Ι, 13. 56: Et
enim quom illi in dicendo inciderint loci, quod persaepe evenit, ut
de dis immortalibus, de pietate, de concordia, de amicitia, de
communi civium, de hominum, de gentium iure, de aequitate, de tem-
perantia, de magnitudine animi. de omni virtutis genere sit (licen-
dum, clamabunt, credo, onmia gymnasia atque omnes philosophorum
scholae sua esse haec omnia propria, nihil omnino ad oratorem per-
tinere.

It is, therefore, clear that Cicero's ideal orator must be equipped
with philosophy as well as with rhetoric, which thus affords the
parallel to the Scriptum, a thorough knowledge of which Augus-
tine' 5 66616513511631 013101 must possess.
