XV. SUMMARY

This comparative study of the rhetorical writings of Augustine
with those οἱ Cicero, leads me to conclude that Augustine modeled
his ideal ecclesiastical orator after the pattern of Cicero’s ideal
orator; that with Cicero, the ideal orator was concerned in suits
and cases of many and various kinds, while the orator of Augustine
deals with the morals and the souls of men and women, and dis-
cusses such lofty themes as God, the Trinity‚ and Immortality.

As regards the moral character of the orator of Augustine‚ his
-conception is the same as that of Cicero, with the exception that the
ecclesiastical orator may not be without serious blemish and defect
of character, and yet may be a powerful orator, and that this excep-
tion is more apparent than real, inasmuch as it is the message of
the ecclesiastica] orator that makes the exception.

As to the duty of the ecclesiastical orator, we may conclude that
this is to be found in the sketch Which Augustine drew, in bold
relies, of the ecclesiastica] orator fashioned after the ideals of the
elaborate and finished treatment of Cicero’s ideal orator.

Also as regards the training of the ecclesiastical orator, as Cicero
would make the study of rhetoric an indispensable prerequisite in
the qualification of his orator, so would Augustine employ it in the
training of his orator in order that he may defend truth and oppose
error the more effectively, and that he may put his hearers in the
proper frame of mind, by neatness and elegance οἱ speech, and in-
struct, delight and move them as occasion may demand, and that
he may be as effective in the defense of truth as his opponents are
in the propagation of error.

Furthermore. as to the time to begin the training of the orator.
ancl the manner of the same, Augustine would have him begin in
early youth, and master the rules quickly, or else they can never be
mastered at all; but that on the other hand, men whose earlier
rhetorical education has been defective, but who are quick intellec-
mally, may become eloquent more readily by reading the speeches‚
and listening to the orations of eloquent men, than by attention to the
rules of eloquence; and that these conceptions are taken from
Cicero.
