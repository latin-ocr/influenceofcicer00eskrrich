THE NORM OF AUGUSTINE , 33

three, one of four and one compounded of two membra, three caesa,
and one membrum. Psychologically‚ the sixth‚ or f—division, con-
tains the climax, since it is in the three caesa that the orator’s feeling
becomes the most tense, preparatory to his final outburst in the last
membrum of the same division. The height of his oratorical
curve having been reached, he begins to descend in the first membrum
of the seventh‚ or g-division, by a return to the word secundum,
since it is by means of this word in the c and d-divisions that he
assumes personal responsibility for his attack against his detractors
Which is to be both thoroughly human and absolutely decisive.

(2) The Boast Proper

a. Glorying after the flesh. A climactic arrangement, since
Hebraei is the national name, Israelitae the religious
name, Semen Abrahae, “heirs of promise‚'’ and minis-
tri Christi.

Hebraei sunt?

et ego,

Israelitae sunt?

>et ego.

Semen Abrahae sunt?
et ego.

Ministri Christi sunt?

(insipiens dico)

super ego,

A period of nine caesa.

b. Hitherto it has been a question of externals. Here Paul
claims the right to be the chief apostle because of his
sufferings. His elaboration of the “super ego” pos-
sesses the merit of the highest art.

Ι. In laboribus plurimum,

in carceribus abundantius,

in plagis supra modum,

in mortibus saepius.

A period of four caesa. Gradatio.
2. A Judaeis quinquies,
quadraginta una minus accepi.

A period of two membra.
