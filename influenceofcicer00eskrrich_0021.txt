AUGUSTINE'S IDEAL ECCLESIASTICAL ORATOR 7

Bishop of Hippo, was in all essential respects‚ the same as the ideal
orator of the great statesman of Rome.

(a) The Jloral character of tlte Ecclesiastical Orator

However great may be the ecclesiastical orator, and however
majestic his style may be. if his life and character be in accord with
his eloquence and with his reaching& he will have far more influence
in inducing compliance on the part of his hearers, than if he be lack-
ing in these essentials. It is possible, however, that the orator’s
life may not be without serious blemish, and yet his teachings be
beneficial to those who hear, seeing that in just the proportion that
his life fails to accord with his teachings, in just this proportion
must he the more forcefully present the truth. Granting this, it still
remains true, that the teacher whose character is upright, and
whose name is free from reproach, if he be fitly trained for his
duties in all particulam, will wield an influence over his hearers that
the great and sublime orator, though of irregular morals‚ will never
accomplish. (D. D. C. IV, 27. 59.)12 To quote Augustine's own lan-
guage, D. D. C. IV, 27. 60: Multis itaque prosunt dicendo quae non
faciunt sed longe pluribus prodessent faciendo quae dicunt. Abun-
dant enim qui malae vitae 'suae defensionem ex ipsis suis praepositis
et doctoribus quaerant, respondentes corde suo, aut etiam si ad hoc
erumpunt, ore suo, atque dicentes: quod mihi praecipis, cur ipse non
facis? Ita fit ut eum non obedienter audiant, qui seipse non audit,
et Dei verbum quod eis praedicatur, simul cum ipso praedicatore
contemnant. Denique Apostolus scribens ad Timotheum, cum dixis-
set, “Nemo adolescentiam tuam contemnat''; subjecit unde non con-
temneretur, atque ait: “Sed forma esto fidelium in sermone, in con-
versatione, in dilectione, in fide, in castitate.'' (1 Tim. IV, 12.)

(b) The Mora! character of the· Leyal Orator

As regards the moral character of Cicero's ideal orator, in De
Orat. Π, 43. 182, he says: Valet igitur multum ad vincendum pro-
bari mores et instituta eorum, qui agent causas, et eorum, pro quibus,
et item improbari adversariorum animosque eorum, apud quos
agetur, conciliari quam maxime ad benevolentiam quom erga ora-
torem tum erga illum, pro quo dicet orator. Conciliantur autern
animi dignitate hominis, rebus gestis, existimatione vitae; quae
facilius ornari possunt, si modo sunt, quam fingi, si nulla sunt.
