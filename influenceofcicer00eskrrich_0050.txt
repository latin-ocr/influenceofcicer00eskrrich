36 CICERo's INFLUENCE UPON AUGUSTINE’S ORATORICAL THEORY

d. On the evils of luxury.
1. The lascivious couches,
Qui dormitis in lectis eburneis,
et lascivitis in stratis vestris:
2. The luxurious tables.
qui comeditis agnum de grege,
et vitulos de medio armenti:
qui canitis ad vocem Psalterii.
A compound period ot' five membra.
e. Admonishes to observe the difference between the music
of the wise and that of lasciviousness.
Sicut David putaverunt se habere vasa cantici ;
bibentes in phialis vinum,
et optimo unguento delibuti:
A period ‚of three membra.
f. Of their hardness of heart.
et nihil patiebantur
super contritione Joseph.
A closing period of two membra.

As regards this passage, Augustine calls attention to the fact
that it contains nothing that sober ears could wish changed and in
addition, points out its prominent features. F irst, the invective
hurled upon the benumbed senses of the drowsy listeners‚ and while
chiding them on their ingratitude, the prophet adorns his utterances
with the names of places as with torches. Simul etiam curn
ista dicuntur, locorum nominibus tanquam luminibus ornatur elo-
quium, quae sunt Sion, Samaria, Chalanne, Emath magna, et Geth
palaestinorum. (D. D. C. IV, 7. 17).

The entire passage is adorned with metaphor and other figures of
speech. as for instance; (a) confiditis in monte Samariae (person),
and domum Israel (meta.); (b) latior terminus (Synec.); (c) in
diem malum (meta), and solio iniquitatis (meta.) ; and (d, 1 and 2)
while not strictly figurative, are quite as bold by virtue of their in-
herent richness of speech. As regards (e), it is full of grace, while
of the last period Augustine says (D. D. C. IV, 7. 20) 2 Miro decore
non dictum est, nihil patiebantur super contritione fratris, sed positus
est pro fratre, Joseph, ut quicumque frater proprio significaretur ejus
nomine, cujus ex fratribus fama praeclara est, vel in malis quae
pendit, vel in bonis quae rependit. The passage is also another ex—
ample os Grandis Dictio.
