ILLUSTRATION OF THE GRAND STYLE 49

in charitate non ficta,

in verbo veritatis,

in virtute Dei:

A group of eighteen caesa, beginning with the same
preposition, in which vehement emotion is given full
sway.

c. , per arma iustitiae a dextris et a sinistris,

per gloriam et ignobilitatem,

per infamiam et bonam famam;

A group of three membra, midway between vigorous
caesa, in which strong emotion is, for the moment,
checked.

d. ut seductores,

et veraces;

ut qui ignoramur,

et cognoscimur ;

quasi morientes,

et ecce vivimus:

coerciti,

et non mortificati3

ut tristes,

semper autem gaudentes;

sicut egeni,

multos autem ditantes;

tanquam nihil habentes,

et omnia possidentes.

A group of fourteen caesa, in which the emotion is less
tense than in the eighteen above.

e. Os nostrum patet ad vos, o Corinthii:

cor nostrum dilatatum est.

A group of two membra which Augustine characterizes
as “ardens''.

“The majestic style of speech differs from the Temperate Style
...... chiefly in that it is not so much decked out with verbal
ornaments as exalted into vehemence by mental emotion. It uses,
indeed, nearly all the ornaments that the other does; but if they
do not happen to be at hand it does not seek for them. For it is
borne on by its own vehemence; and the force of the thought, not
the desire for ornament, makes it seize upon any beauty of expres-
sion that comes in its way.’' (D. D. C. IV, 20. 42).
