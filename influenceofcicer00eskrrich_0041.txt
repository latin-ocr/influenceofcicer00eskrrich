IX. THE INTERPRETATION OF THE DIVISIONS
OF STYLE

In an earlier work, entitled Contra Cresconinm Donatistant,
Augustine draws a very sharp line of demarcation between dia-
lectic and eloquence‚ and shows that dialectic is the instrument with
which the ecclesiastical orator must debate and contend, and that
eloquence must be employed whenever the occasion may demand.
In Contra cresconium, I, 2, he defines eloquence as vero facultas
dicendi -est, congruenter explicans quae sentimus: qua tunc utendum
est, cum recta sentimus.

Again in the same treatise, Ι, 16, he says: quaedam copiose
ornateque explicare, hoc est eloquentem quaedam vero subtiliter ar-
guteque disserere, hoc est dialectice.

Again: Eloquens ille appellandus est, qui non solum copiose et
ornate sed etiam veraciter dicit. And: dialecticus ille appellandus
est, qui non solum subtiliter, sed veraciter etiam disserit. He further
adds, Contra Cresconinm, Ι, 20: Si autem presse atque constricte,
magis eum disputatorem quam dictorem appellare consueverunt,
qualiter agit idem apostolus de circumcisione et praeputio patris
Abraham, vel distinctione legis et gratiae.

Here the fields are dialectic and eloquence‚ dialectic being the art
of discussing sub-tly and accurately without ornamentation of speech,
and eloquence the art of speaking copiously and eloquently, and at
the same time truthfully; and the division is essentially the same as
that employed in the fourth book of De Doctrina C hristiana. Dia-
lectic, in Contra Cresconimn, is the· res of the later work (D. D. C.
IV, 12. 273st and eloquence the modus. quo (ibid).

   
   
  

This is, then, a two-sold division, in which the one part is to
discuss simply, and the other is to employ whatever devices of Ἰ
rhetoric and oratory may be necessary. In the last mentioned
reference, Augustine says: Horum trium quod primo loco positum
est, hoc est docendi necessitas, in rebus est constituta quas dicimus;
reliqua duo, in modo quo dicimus. This division is also a two-sold
one, into the res and the modus quo, and corresponds exactly with
the above-mentioned division in the Contra C resconimn.
