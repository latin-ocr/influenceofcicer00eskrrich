56 CICERo’s INFLUENCE UPoN AUGUSTINE'S ORATORICAL THEORY

As regards the possession of wisdom‚ the ecclesiastical orator
should speak with wisdom, even though it be without eloquence,
especially when his hearers are pleased with his eloquence, and
think that since he speaks fluently, he must also be wise; that this
idea, while an evident one, is specifically set forth by Cicero.

Again, as to the kind of wisdom necessary for the ecclesiastical
orator in order that he may speak with wisdom even though it be
without eloquence. he should possess an exact knowledge of the
words of Scripture, as well as a deep insight into their spiritual
meaning, to the end that he may the more surely enrich his speech,
which may otherwise be poor, and that he may the more certainly
influence his hearers as he may see fit; that corresponding to this
notion is that conception of Cicero, by which philosophy takes the
place of Scripture, and in place of the exact words and passages of
Scripture, would substitute certain “topica'' which fall under the
domain of philo-sophy; that as Augustine would have his orator
grounded in Scripture and rhetoric, so would Cicero have his
equipped correspondingly in philosophy and rhetoric.

Also that he would have his orator read eloquent speeches, and
listen to eloquent men ; that he, like Cicero, would have his orator
practice himself in the art of writing; that, as with Cicero, so would
he have his orator choose an ideal model to imitate.

F urthermore, that the offices of the ecclesiastica] orator are de-
rived from Cicero; that Cicero's orator, while dealing with the many
phases of legal and civic questions, has for his object the same thing
as that of the ecclesiastica] orator, that is, to teach, to delight‚ and
to move, and that these functions are thoroughly natural and psy-
chological, and deal respectively, with the intellect, the sensibilities‚
and the will of the hearer. f

Again, that from the three-sold function of the orator, that of
teaching, delighting and persuading, there are naturally developed
three styles of oratory psychologically adapted to these offices‚ and
which may be called the plain, the Middle, and the Grand Styles,
whose technical nomenclature, in the original, is derived directly
from Cicero; that from the adverbs, submisse, temperate, and
granditer, Orator, 29. 101, Augustine derived the names of his three
styles of oratory, that is, Submissa dictio, Temperata dictio, and
Grandis dictio. Further, that as with Cicero, so with Augustine,
the Plain Style is intended for use in instruction, in explanation, and
