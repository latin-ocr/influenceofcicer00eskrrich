adapted to old age, so there is an eloquence peculiarly appropriate
to the ecclesiastical orator; and that in the norm of Augustine’s
sacred oratory, as represented by the best specimens from Paul,
Amos, Cyprian, and Ambrose, he chose as his voice unit, or units,
of oratorical rhythm, the caesa, the membra, and the pe1·iod; that
these divisions are, within certain limits, arbitrary‚ it being often-
times diffi'cult to distinguish between caesa and membra, since both
are statements finished in a single tone of voice, and these units taken
together in accordance with the oratorical thought or movement
which they comprehend‚ form what may be called a group, a divi-
sion, or a period; and that in each style, the Plain, the Middle, and
the Grand, these caesa and membra are vital constituents. and are
therefore capable of analysis; that however arbitrary the process
may appear, membra being cut up now into caesa, and caesa now
being prolonged into membra, there are nevertheless, an oratorical,
a rhythmical‚ and a thought structure in each group, division, or
period, which are easily discernible.

Finally, as regards the fundamental differences between Cicero
and Augustine, it is clear that the ecclesiastical orator differs from
the ideal orator of Cicero, in that he is always dealing with great
themes which pertain to the welfare of humanity both here and here-
after, such as love, mercy, justice and the like, whereas the ideal
orator is confined to themes which, from their very character, cannot
attain to such dignity, such as debt, citizenship, personal rights and
the like; that there is a quality, sui generis, belonging to the eccle-
siastica] orator, which Cicero's ideal orator can never possess, the
felicitous union of Christian wisdom as guide, with eloquence as a
faithful attendant; that the ecclesiastical orator should pray to God
for wisdom, eloquence, and guidance, and that speaker and hearers
be put in the proper frame of heart and mind, a thought entirely
Christian: that whereas Cicero would use the Middle Style to please
by the elegance and beauty of its diction, Augustine would employ
it for the nobler purpose of persuading men and women to live more
worthy and useful lives; that the ecclesiastical orator may (leliver
with great effect, what has been written with wisdom and eloquence
by another, without being considered as having practiced deception
upon those who hear.
