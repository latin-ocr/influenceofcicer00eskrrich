111. THE OFFICES OF THE ECCLESIASTICAL ORATOR

After having treated of the ecclesiastical orator in the manner
as shown in the preceding chapter, Augustine proceeds to discuss
the specific duties 01 1110 orator. His moral character, his educa-
11011 111 general, his study 01 rhetoric in early youth, his store 01
wisdom, his mastery of the general laws 01 eloquence, must all be
directed to a specific purpose 11 110 would not be foredoomed to a
speedy and ignominious 13111110. Ι11 accordance with Cicero, he
assigns to the ecclesiastical orator three main offices, which, at the
same time, are both natural and psychological. They are natural
because they make the function 01 1110 013101 commensurate with
the mental possibilities 01 111311, and they are pyschological because
each specific duty 01 1110 013101 15 adapted to a special faculty 01
1110 1111111311 mind. These three offices are, (1) to instruct; (2) to
please; (3) to move; and their natural and legitimate spheres 01
3011011 310 111 1110 regions, (1) 01 1110 1111011001; (2) 01 1110 sensibili-
ties; (3) 01 1110 will, respectively. To instruct is 01 1110 1111011001,
10 3101150 or soothe the emotions‚ to move the will is the o-rator’s part
01 1110 program in dealing with humanity‚ 35 50011 by both Cicero
and Augustine. To reach the standard 01 excellence in the art 01
speaking, wherein the skill 01 1110 013101 app-eals with equal 10100
to the soul 01 111311, through any .or all 01 111050 3110111105, 15 10 be 3
great orator; while to stir men to frenzy, or 10 3101150 1110111 10 3011011
even against their wills, is the problem 01 3 Demosthenes or a
Savonarola, a Cicero or a Spurgeon.

As regards these offices 01 1110 00010513511031 013101, Augustine,
D. D. C. IV, 12. 27, says: Dixit ergo quidam eloquens, et verum
dixit, ita dicere debere eloquentem, ut doceat, ut delectet, ut flectat.

This three-sold function 01 1110 013101, 110 specifically states, was
so defined by Cicero, who, in the Orator, 21. 69, says: Erit igitur
eloquens—hunc enim. auctore Antonio quaerimus—is, qui in 1010
causisque civilibus ita dicet, ut probet, ut delectet, ut flectat. Probare
necessitatis est, delectare suavitatis, flectere victoriae: nam id unum
ex omnibus ad obtinendas causas potest plurimum. Sed quot officia
oratoris, tot sunt genera dicendi: subtile in probando, modicum in
delectando, vehemens in flectendo; in quo uno vis omnis oratoris est.
It will be observed here that Augustine does not quote Cicero 001-
