IO CICERO‘S INFLUENCE UPON AUGUSTINE’S ORATORICAL THEORY

consolando? Historia vero testis temporum, lux veritatis, vita
memoriae, magistra vitae, nuntia vetustatis, qua voce alia nisi
oratoris immortalitati commendatur?

From these passages it is clear that Cicero had in mind a stand-
ard of an orator to which it is impossible to attain3 that he is never
to be perceived with eye or ear; that he can only be conceived of
ideally by the mind; that his arena is the forum; that he is to deal
with civil cases; that he is to use this faculty in swaying the tumults
of the people‚ and in arousing the feelings of judges and the dignity
of the senate; that he is to assist the suppliant and the affiicted, offer
security from danger. maintain the civil rights of men, protect him-
self, defy evil men; that he is to rouse the languid, calm the excited,
bring the wickedness of mankind to destruction; to exhort, reprove,
reclaim‚ praise‚ break the force of unlawful passion and alleviate
those stricken with grief.

We are, therefore, justified in concluding that what Augustine
would have his ecclesiastical orator do, save “preach the Word‚’'
is to be found in Cicero’s concep-tion of the duties of his ideal orator;
that. he said in terse and succinet form, though differing in phrase—
ology from that of Cicero, what Cic-ero said in a more elaborate
and rhetorical fashion, and that his ideal, in this particular, is, in all
essentia] respects, the same as the ideal of Cicero.

(a) The Traiuiny of tlze Ecclesiastical Ora-tor

To accomplish that which the foregoing passages impose on the
orator, it is necessary that the ecclesiastical orator avail himself of
all the arts and devices with which the orator in general is con-
versant, and that he study Rhetoric.

Rhetoric is the common ground between Augustine’s orator and
'the orator of Cicero. Augusffine, therefore, says in his treatise,
D. D. C. IV, 2. 3 :13 Nam cum per artem rhetoricam et vera suadean-
tur et falsa, quis audeat dicere, adversus mendacium in defensoribus
suis inermem debere consistere veritatem, ut videlicet illi qui res
falsas persuadere conantur, noverint auditorem vel benevolum, vel
intentum, vel docilem prooemio facere; isti autem non noverint? illi
falsa breviter, aperte, verissimiliter; et isti vera sic narrent, ut
audire taedeat, intelligere non pateat, credere postremo non libeat?
