X. THE NORM OF AUGUSTINE3 EXAMPLES FROM
PAUL AND AMOS

As there is an eloquence adapted to youth, and an eloquence
becoming to old age, so there is an eloquence peculiarly appropriate
to the character of the ecclesiastical orator. It is of a type that is
both unique and divine, since it deals with God, with man, With
morals‚ and with the future state of the soul. It places him at once
on the very highest plane, and imposes on him the most exalted ob—
ligations. Therefore‚ his speech and language should comport with
the dignity of his theme and the sacredness of his office.

That Augustine chose both a high type ot' oratory for his norm,
and one in strict accord with the proper conception of the character
of the ecclesiastical orator, may be seen from an examination of the
extracts, Which he takes as examples of model eloquence‚ from the
writings of the Apostle Paul, and the Prophet Amos. These are
shown to possess both wisdom and eloquence, wisdom being the
guide, and eloquence the attendant, neither displayed in a gaudy or
conspicuous fashion, yet both harmoniously and artistically blended
after the pattern of the finest art.

Following are the passages with analyses thereos.
