INTRODUCTION 3

si alterum sit optandum. malim equidem indisertam prudentiam quam
stultitiam loquacem; si quaerimus quid unum excellat ex omnibus,
docto oratori palma danda est3 quem si patiuntur eundem esse
philosophum, sublata controversia est. Sin cos diiungent, hoc erunt
inferiores, quod in oratore perfecto inest illorum omnis scientia, in
philosophorum autem cognitione non continuo inest eloquentia; quae
quamvis contemnatur ab eis, necesse est tamen aliquem cumulum
illorum artibus adferre videatur.

As to the relative values, however, ot* philosophy and rhetoric,
further than that wisdom without eloquence is preferable to elo-
quence without wisdom, Augustine does not concern himself. Yet
he makes a like assumption, in the case of the training of the ecclesi-
astical orator, as that made by the teachers of rhetoric, that although
there can be no need in theological investigations for error to be
made to appear superior to nuth, yet truth when wielded by a
worthy and conscientious defender, can be made to do quick and
effective service if adorned by the noble art of rhetoric.
