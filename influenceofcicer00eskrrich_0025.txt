AUGUSTINE'S IDEAL ECCLESIASTICAL ORATOR 11

illi fallacibus argumentis veritatem oppugnent, asserant falsitatem;
isti nec vera defendere, nec falsa valeant refutare? illi animos
audientium in errorem moventes impellentesque (licendo terreant,
contristent, exhilarent, exhortentur ardenter; isti pro veritate, lenti
frigidique dormitent? Quis ita desipiat, ut hoc sapiat? Cum ergo
sit in medio posita facultas eloquii, quae ad persuadenda seu prava
seu recta valet plurimum: cur non bonorum studio comparatur, ut
militet veritati, si eam mali ad obtinendas perversas vanasque causas
in usus iniquitatis et erroris usurpant?

It is, then, by the proper employment of rhetoric, in his defense
of truth, and opposition to error and wrong, that the ecclesiastical
orator is to put his hearers in a friendly, attentive and teachable
frame of mind; he must not be tedious, cumbersome or unpleasant

truth with all the attractiveness that the art of rhetoric will allow,

(b) lee Traininy of the Leyal Orator

W ere it necessary in the face of Cicero’s own rhetorical train-

passage wherein rhetoric is declared to be the foundation on which
oratory rests, reference might be made to De Inventione, I, 5. 7.
After having stated how men of earlier times, who had depended on
strength of body, had been rescued from barbarous conditions‚ and
had made for themselves customs, institutions, states and laws
through the power of oratory and eloquence, he shows by what
means this power is obtained. To quote his own words: Ut medici-
nae materiam dicamus morbos ac vulnera, quod in his omnis
medicina versetur, item, quibus in rebus versatur ars et facultas
oratoria, eas res materiam artis rhetoricae nominamus.

Thus we see that Cicero makes rhetoric a great essential in
the education of the orator.

W‘HEN AND How THE ORATOR Is To TRAIN HIMSELF

To attain to great excellence in sacred oratory, the rules of elo-
quence should be mastered in youth, and quickly, or else they never
will be thoroughly learned. Nam et ipsos Romanae principes elo-
