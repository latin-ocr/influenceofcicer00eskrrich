VH. THE GRAND STYLE, OR GRANDIS DICTIO

The object of the Grand Style is to move men, either to do, or
to refrain from doing something. The teachings of the ecclesiastical
orator are in vain and the pleasures of his eloquence of no per-
manent value if the hearer be not led to carry out in practice the
things which he has been taught, and for which both the teaching
and the art of pleasing were brought into play. The eloquent divine
must not only teach that he be understood and speak to give delight,
but he must also move those who hear. If truth of itself cannot
do this, if it fail when reinforced by the arts that delight the
aesthetic nature, then nothing remains but to subdue the obdurate
heart with the conquering power of eloquence. All the ornaments
of speech and thought, provided they do not weaken the force of
eloquence, can be utilized. It is assumed that the hearer is in-
structed‚ that he has been conciliated to the speaker, and therefore
the Grandis Dictio leaps beyond the barriers imposed by didactics‚
refuses to be limited by the confines of merely intellectual and
aesthetic delight, and is content with nothing short of the entire

’ region of the human soul, where all its faculties can be touched,

In D. D. C. IV, 13. 29, Augustine thus expresses himself: Prop-
ter eos autem quibus fastidientibus non placet veritas, si alio quae-
cumque modo, nisi eo modo dicatur, ut placeat et sermo dicentis,
datus est in eloquentia non parvus etiam delectationi locus. Quae
tamen addita non sufficit duris, quos nec intellexisse, nec docentis
elocutione delectatos esse profu-erit. Quid enim haec duo conferunt
homini, qui et confitetur verum, et collaudat eloquium, nec inclinat
assensum, propter quem solum, cum aliquid suadetur, rebus quae
dicuntur invigilat dicentis intentio? Si enim talia docentur quae
credere vel nosse sufficiat, nihil est aliud eis consentire, nisi
confiteri vera esse. Cum vero id docetur quod agendum est
et ideo docetur ut agatur, frustra persuadetur verum esse quod
dicitur, frustra placet modus ipse quo dicitur, si non ita discitur ut
agatur. Oportet igitur eloquentem ecclesiasticum, quando suadet
aliquid quod agendum est, non solum docere ut instruat, et delectare
