V. THE PLAIN STYLE, OR SUBMISSA DICTIO

Following the accepted lines of argument, Augustine shows that
the first and fundamental principle of the Submissa Dictio is to
instruct the beares, to explain that which is obscure, and to satisfy
the demands of his intellect by an exposition of the truth. To this
end the ecclesiastical orator should ever be mindful of the obliga-
tions he has assumed, and should guard against supposing that
teaching consists in making his hearers like that which they had
formerly disliked, or in making them do what they had previously
refused to do. Teaching depends upon the subject matter, and the
orator should be clear and intelligible at all points if he would be
understood.

Therefore, teaching must satisfy the demands of the most critical
intellects, and display the truth in whatever aspect it may be neces-
sary to instruct the hearer. Yet it is not inadmissible for the
didactic style of eloquence to receive a most exquisite literary polish.
On the contrary, it is as capable of a literary finish as 'any other
department of oratory, and should never degenerate into a rude and
unfinished form, that its influence may extend beyond the small
circle ot' eager students who accept truth for its own sake, regard-
less of its literary form or setting. In D. D. C. IV, ΙΙ. 26, Augustine
says: Prorsus haec est in docendo eloquentia, qua fit dicendo, non
ut libeat quod horrebat, aut ut fiat quod pigebat, sed ut appareat
quod latebat.

As regards the offices of the orator, Augustine, on teaching, in
D. D. C. IV, 12. 27, says: Horum trium quod primo loco positum
est, hoc est docendi necessitas, in rebus est constituta quas dicimus ;
reliqua duo, in modo quo dicimus. Qui ergo dicit curn docere vult,
quamdiu non intelligetur, nondum se existimet dixisse quod vult,
ei quern vult docere. Quia etsi dixit quod ipse intelligit, nondum
illi dixisse putandus est, a quo intellectus non est; si vero intellectus
est, quocumque modo dixerit, dixit.

It is, therefore, evident that, before the ecclesiastical orator
should endeavo'r to move his hearers, they should be taught what
is the proper courseeto pursue, and that accordingly docere necessi-
tatis est. For this reason it is not, primarily, the intention of the
Plain Style to please, with the ornamentations of language, but to
