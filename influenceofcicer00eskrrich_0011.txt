PREFACE

This dissertation is the outcome of a year's work, 1902-03, in
the University of Chicago‚ with Professor George Lincoln
Hendrickson, now of Yale University. The work done under his
direction was a technical study of the rhetorical writings of Cicero.
In studying the influence of Cicero upon Augustine with regard to
the three styles, while preparing a thesis for the degree ⁶of Master
of Arts, it was impossible not to be impressed with his influence
upon Augustine's oratorical system as a whole. Ι have, therefore,
attempted to show the influence of Cicero in its entirety upon
Augustine's theory of oratorical training for the preacher.

Augustine, in an earlier ‘work, entitled Contra cresconium,
touched somewhat upon matters of a rhetorical character, though
the best of his technical treatment of the subject is to be found in
a small work entitled De Doctrina Christiana, in four books, three
of which are devoted to the method of interpreting Scripture
through the ascertaining of its proper meaning, and the fourth
to the manner of making this meaning known in the most
effective way. The fourth book, then, is rhetorical and literary and
draws on the theory of Cicero as treated in the De Oratore, the
Brutus and the Orator.

Finally‚ whatever excellence of method of treatment this dis-
sertation may possess is due, in no small measure, to the instructors,
in general, with whom I came in contact, and in particular, 'to Pro-
fessor Hendrickson. Any errors of interpretation, treatment or de-

tail, are chargeable to myself alone.

NoTE. In Die Antike Kunstprosa‚ von Eduard Norden, Zweiter
Band, Zweiter Abdruck, 1909, page 617, the statement is made that
the first three books of De Doctrina Christiana pertain to inventio,
and the third to elocutio; and that as regards Augustine, his grosse
Lehrmeister war Cicero, der auctor Romani eloquii. He further
calls attention to the fact that the three styles are taken from
Cicero. This is what Augustine himself tells us in so many words.
On page 505 Norden cites a passage of Scripture quoted by Augus-
tine as showing membra and caesa, and in other places free reference
is made to Augustine.
