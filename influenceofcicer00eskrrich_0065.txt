DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AUGUSTINE AND CICERO 51

pecunia custodire debemus, dicente Domino; “qui in minimo fidelis
est, et in magno fidelis est.’' (D. D. C. IV, 18. 35).

The orator of Augustine, then, in treating of matters such as the
above, or of one brother going to law with another, D. D. C. IV,
18. 36, or of the statement of Jesus relative to the giving of a cup
of cold water in His name. ibid„ 37, should never consider his sub-
ject unimportant, but should discuss it with a tongue of fire. This
the orator of Cicero could never do.

THERE 1s A QUALITY IN THE EchESIAsT1cAL ORATOR wHICH THE
ORATOR OF CICERO Dosss Nor Possnss

Augustine lays special emphasis upon the fact that it is not the
qualities which the ecclesiastical orator has in common with the
pagan orator, that give him delight, but the possession of an
eloquence combined with wisdom all his own. He uses the eloquence
of Cicero’s model in such a way that it is conspicuous neither for its
presence nor its absence. In cases where it is in conspicuous evi-
dence, the matters spoken ot' are of such a character that it bursts
forth spontaneously, as if wisdom were walking out ot' her house,
and eloquence, her faithful attendant, following. Sed non ipsa me
plus quam dici potest in illa eloquentia delectant, quae sunt his viris
cum oratoribus Gentilium poetisve communia: illud magis admiror
et stupeo, quod ista nostra eloquentia ita usi sunt per alteram quan-
dam eloquentiam suam, ut nec deesset eis, nec emineret in eis: quia
eam nec improbari ab illis, nec ostentari oportebat: quorum alterum
fieret, si vitaretur, alterum putari posset, si facile agnosceretur.
Et in quibus forte locis agnoscitur a doctis, tales res dicuntur, ut
verba quibus dicuntur, non a dicente adhibita, sed ipsis rebus velut
sponte subiuncta videantur; quasi sapientiam de domo sua, id est,
pectore sapientis procedere intelligas, et tanquam inseparabilem
famulam etiam non vocatam sequi eloquentiam. (D. D. C. IV, 6. Io).

THE ECCLESIASTICAL ORATOR SHOULD EMPLov THE TEMPERATE
STYLE, As WELL As THE GRAND Smne, IN MOVING
ΜΕΝ ΤΟ ACTION

With Cicero, the object of the Temperate Style is to please by
beauty of expression. Herein Augustine takes a step far in advance
